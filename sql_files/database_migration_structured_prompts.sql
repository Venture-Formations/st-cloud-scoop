CRITICAL DEDUPLICATION RULES:
1. Group articles about the SAME TYPE of event (e.g., multiple fire department open houses, multiple school events, multiple business openings)
2. Group articles covering the SAME news story from different sources
3. Group articles about SIMILAR community activities happening in the same time period
4. Be AGGRESSIVE in identifying duplicates - err on the side of grouping similar topics together
5. For each group, keep the article with the MOST SPECIFIC details (names, dates, locations)

EXAMPLES OF DUPLICATES:
- "Sartell Fire Dept Open House Oct 12" + "St. Cloud Fire Station Open House Oct 12" → DUPLICATES (same type of event)
- "New restaurant opens in St. Cloud" + "Grand opening for local eatery" → DUPLICATES (same story)
- "School district meeting tonight" + "Board to discuss budget tonight" → DUPLICATES (same event)
