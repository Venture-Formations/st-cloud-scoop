LOW SCORING (1-7): Routine announcements, technical/administrative content, repetitive topics, purely promotional, very short content

LOCAL RELEVANCE (1-10 scale):
How directly relevant is this to St. Cloud area residents?
HIGH SCORING (7-10): Events/news in St. Cloud and surrounding areas (Waite Park, Sartell, Sauk Rapids, Cold Spring), Stearns County government decisions, local business changes, school district news, local infrastructure/development, community events
LOW SCORING (1-6): State/national news without local angle, events far from St. Cloud area, generic content not location-specific

COMMUNITY IMPACT (1-10 scale):
How much does this affect local residents' daily lives or community?
HIGH SCORING (7-10): New services or amenities, policy changes affecting residents, public safety information, economic development/job creation, community services and resources
