You are evaluating a news article for inclusion in a local St. Cloud, Minnesota newsletter.

CRITICAL: You MUST use these exact scoring scales:
- interest_level: Integer between 1 and 20 (NOT 1-10, MUST BE 1-20)
- local_relevance: Integer between 1 and 10
- community_impact: Integer between 1 and 10

IMAGE PENALTY: ${post.hasImage ? 'This post HAS an image.' : 'This post has NO image - subtract 5 points from interest_level.'}

INTEREST LEVEL (1-20 scale, NOT 1-10):
Rate from 1 to 20 where 20 is most interesting. Use the full range 1-20.
HIGH SCORING (15-20): Unexpected developments, human interest stories, breaking news, unique events, broad appeal, fun/entertaining
MEDIUM SCORING (8-14): Standard local news, business updates, routine events with some appeal
LOW SCORING (1-7): Routine announcements, technical/administrative content, repetitive topics, purely promotional, very short content

LOCAL RELEVANCE (1-10 scale):
How directly relevant is this to St. Cloud area residents?
HIGH SCORING (7-10): Events/news in St. Cloud and surrounding areas (Waite Park, Sartell, Sauk Rapids, Cold Spring), Stearns County government decisions, local business changes, school district news, local infrastructure/development, community events
LOW SCORING (1-6): State/national news without local angle, events far from St. Cloud area, generic content not location-specific

COMMUNITY IMPACT (1-10 scale):
How much does this affect local residents' daily lives or community?
HIGH SCORING (7-10): New services or amenities, policy changes affecting residents, public safety information, economic development/job creation, community services and resources
LOW SCORING (1-6): Individual achievements with limited community effect, internal organizational matters, entertainment without broader impact

BONUS: Add 2 extra points to total_score for stories mentioning multiple local communities or regional impact.

BLANK RATING CONDITIONS: Leave all fields blank if:
- Description contains ≤10 words
- Post is about weather happening today/tomorrow
- Post is written before an event happening "today"/"tonight"/"this evening"
- Post mentions events happening "today", "tonight", or "this evening" (we do not include same-day events)
- Post is about lost, missing, or found pets (lost dogs, cats, etc.)
- Post is about incidents currently happening, ongoing emergencies, or breaking news that will be outdated by tomorrow (accidents, police responses, active situations, traffic incidents, emergency responses)

Article Title: ${post.title}
Article Description: ${post.description || 'No description available'}
Article Content: ${post.content ? post.content.substring(0, 1000) + '...' : 'No content available'}

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
The interest_level field MUST be between 1 and 20, NOT between 1 and 10.

Response format:
{
  "interest_level": <integer 1-20, use full range>,

  topicDeduper: (posts: Array<{ title: string; description: string }>) => `
You are identifying duplicate stories for a LOCAL NEWSLETTER. Your goal is to prevent readers from seeing multiple articles about the SAME TYPE OF EVENT or SIMILAR TOPICS.

CRITICAL DEDUPLICATION RULES:
1. Group articles about the SAME TYPE of event (e.g., multiple fire department open houses, multiple school events, multiple business openings)
2. Group articles covering the SAME news story from different sources
3. Group articles about SIMILAR community activities happening in the same time period
4. Be AGGRESSIVE in identifying duplicates - err on the side of grouping similar topics together
5. For each group, keep the article with the MOST SPECIFIC details (names, dates, locations)

EXAMPLES OF DUPLICATES:
- "Sartell Fire Dept Open House Oct 12" + "St. Cloud Fire Station Open House Oct 12" + "Sauk Rapids Fire Dept Open House Oct 12" → ALL DUPLICATES (same type of event)
- "New restaurant opens in St. Cloud" + "Grand opening for local eatery" → DUPLICATES (same story)
- "School district meeting tonight" + "Board to discuss budget tonight" → DUPLICATES (same event)

Articles to analyze (array indices are 0-based - first article is index 0):
${posts.map((post, i) => `${i}. ${post.title}\n   ${post.description || 'No description'}`).join('\n\n')}

IMPORTANT: Use 0-based indexing (first article = 0, second = 1, etc.)

Respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "topic_signature": "<brief topic description>",
      "primary_article_index": <number (0-based)>,
      "duplicate_indices": [<array of numbers (0-based)>],

REQUIREMENTS:
- Maximum 50 words
- Natural, engaging language
- Paraphrase completely - don't copy original wording
- Capture the essence and appeal of the event
- Write in third person
- Include key details that make it interesting

Craft a front-page newspaper headline for the next-day edition based on the most interesting article.

Articles in this newsletter:
${articles.map((article, i) => `${i + 1}. ${article.headline}\n   ${article.content.substring(0, 100)}...`).join('\n\n')}

HARD RULES:
- ≤ 40 characters (count every space and punctuation) - this allows room for ice cream emoji prefix
- Title Case; avoid ALL-CAPS words
- Omit the year
- No em dashes (—)
- No colons (:) or other punctuation that splits the headline into two parts
- Return only the headline text—nothing else (no emoji, that will be added automatically)

IMPACT CHECKLIST:
- Lead with a power verb
- Local pride—include place name if it adds punch
- Trim fluff—every word earns its spot
- Character audit—recount after final trim

STYLE GUIDANCE: Write the headline as if the event just happened, not as a historical reflection or anniversary. Avoid words like 'Legacy,' 'Honors,' 'Remembers,' or 'Celebrates History.' Use an urgent, active voice suitable for a breaking news front page.

CREATIVITY REQUIREMENT: Each generation should produce a unique headline variation. Explore different angles, power verbs, and emotional hooks. Consider multiple ways to frame the same story - focus on different aspects, beneficiaries, or impacts. Never repeat previous generations.

Respond with ONLY the headline text - no JSON, no quotes, no extra formatting. Just the headline itself.`,

AGE GROUP ANALYSIS:
- age_groups: Only include if people are clearly visible and identifiable
- Age categories: "preschool" (0-4), "elementary" (5-11), "high_school" (12-17), "adult" (18-64), "older_adult" (65+)
- count: Number of people in each age group
- conf: Confidence level (0-1) for age group classification
- Set to null if no people detected or ages cannot be determined

IMPORTANT: Only include OCR fields if readable text is actually present. Only include age_groups if people are visible and ages can be reasonably estimated. Set to null if not detected. Prioritize tags that match the St. Cloud newsletter's common article themes: education, public safety, community events, sports (especially hockey), seasonal activities, business development, and healthcare.`,
