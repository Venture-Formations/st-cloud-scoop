You are evaluating a news article for inclusion in a local St. Cloud, Minnesota newsletter. Rate on three dimensions using a 1-10 scale:

INTEREST LEVEL (1-10): How intriguing, surprising, or engaging is this story?
HIGH SCORING: Unexpected developments, human interest stories, breaking news, unique events, broad appeal, fun/entertaining

HIGH SCORING: Events/news in St. Cloud and surrounding areas (Waite Park, Sartell, Sauk Rapids, Cold Spring), Stearns County government decisions, local business changes, school district news, local infrastructure/development, community events
LOW SCORING: State/national news without local angle, events far from St. Cloud area, generic content not location-specific

COMMUNITY IMPACT (1-10): How much does this affect local residents' daily lives or community?
HIGH SCORING: New services or amenities, policy changes affecting residents, public safety information, economic development/job creation, community services and resources
LOW SCORING: Individual achievements with limited community effect, internal organizational matters, entertainment without broader impact

BONUS: Add 2 extra points to total_score for stories mentioning multiple local communities or regional impact.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Maximum 50 words
- Natural, engaging language
- Paraphrase completely - don't copy original wording
- Capture the essence and appeal of the event
- Write in third person
- Include key details that make it interesting

Respond with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "event_summary": "<concise 50-word summary>",

  subjectLineGenerator: (articles: Array<{ headline: string; content: string }>) => `
Craft a front-page newspaper headline for the next-day edition based on the most interesting article.

Articles in this newsletter:
${articles.map((article, i) => `${i + 1}. ${article.headline}\n   ${article.content.substring(0, 100)}...`).join('\n\n')}

HARD RULES:
- ≤ 40 characters (count every space and punctuation) - this allows room for ice cream emoji prefix
- Title Case; avoid ALL-CAPS words
- Omit the year
- No em dashes (—)
- No colons (:) or other punctuation that splits the headline into two parts
- Return only the headline text—nothing else (no emoji, that will be added automatically)

IMPACT CHECKLIST:
- Lead with a power verb
- Local pride—include place name if it adds punch
- Trim fluff—every word earns its spot
- Character audit—recount after final trim

STYLE GUIDANCE: Write the headline as if the event just happened, not as a historical reflection or anniversary. Avoid words like 'Legacy,' 'Honors,' 'Remembers,' or 'Celebrates History.' Use an urgent, active voice suitable for a breaking news front page.

CREATIVITY REQUIREMENT: Each generation should produce a unique headline variation. Explore different angles, power verbs, and emotional hooks. Consider multiple ways to frame the same story - focus on different aspects, beneficiaries, or impacts. Never repeat previous generations.

Respond with ONLY the headline text - no JSON, no quotes, no extra formatting. Just the headline itself.`,
